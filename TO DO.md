## data processing

response option location & trials per block is missing for many domains; after excel file is completed update data processing

pull test length into permutated non sensitivity analysis: trials per block * blockpairs * 2

change permutation iterations to 1000



## analyses

remove hunger from analyses

add moderator metas

- including one for test length



## measures

finalize stimuli and parameters files

- Shapes & colors (1)	shapesandcolors YN rule
- Shapes & colors (2)	shapesandcolors YN correct
- Shapes & colors (3)	shapesandcolors TF correct 
- Shapes & colors (4)	shapesandcolors TF rule 
- Shapes & colors (5)	shapes and colors exp 2 full rule
- Shapes & colors (6)	shapes and colors exp 2 minimal rule 
- Shapes & colors (7)	shapes and colors exp 3



## manuscript

update manuscript to discuss negative effects and within domain variation due to task parameters

modify inclusion/exclusion criteria to say that trial level data and task parameters for what was done in the experiment must both be available, to exclude food irap; and that they must use known stimuli and exclude interventions

note that inclusions criterion of complete data means no participants who failed practice blocks

note that block_order is permanently missing for Disgust (1) & Sexuality (1)
