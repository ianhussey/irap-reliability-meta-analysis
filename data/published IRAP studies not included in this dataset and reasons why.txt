# Datasets from our published IRAP studies that aren't included in the dataset here & reasons why

## Studies that used older versions of the IRAP that did not produce trial-level data in a format that made it amenable to including in the dataset:

- Drake et al. (2015) Exploring the reliability and convergent validity of implicit racial evaluations. 
- Drake et al. (2016) Honest politics: Evaluating candidate perceptions for the 2012 US election with the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure.
- Hussey & Barnes-Holmes (2012) The implicit relational assessment procedure as a measure of implicit depression and the role of psychological flexibility.
- Hussey, Ni Mhaoileoin, et al (2016) The IRAP is nonrelative but not acontextual: Changes to the contrast category influence menâ€™s dehumanization of women. 
- Hussey, Barnes-Holmes & Booth (2016) Individuals with current suicidal ideation demonstrate implicit 'fearlessness of death'.
