| **Body:**    | 22-Jul-2020  Re: "The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure demonstrates poor internal consistency and test-retest reliability: A meta-analysis" (MS # PSPB-20-369)  Dear Dr. Hussey:  Thank you for submitting your manuscript to the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin (PSPB). In an effort to streamline the review process and enhance the speed with which authors receive feedback, editors of the journal pre-screen manuscripts before they are sent to reviewers. This enables us to provide a quick decision on manuscripts which are identified as unlikely to be published on PSPB.  As you may know, PSPB receives more than 700 submissions per year, but only publishes approximately 125 papers each year. Thus, the page limitations of the journal dictate that only a fraction of submitted manuscripts can be accepted. This means that, in some instances, papers without major flaws may be rejected due to their level or scope of contribution.  The current manuscript includes a meta-analyses of (published and unpublished) studies, conducted in two labs, in which the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) was used. Several approaches were employed to estimate both internal consistency and test-retest reliability of this measure. The results suggest that the reliability of IRAP is rather low. The present research provides thus an additional and, likely, more compelling evidence on the low reliability of the IRAP. I read the paper with interest and I found many positive aspects in it. It is well-written, and the use of best practice to estimate test-retest reliability and internal consistency was definitely remarkable. However, given its focus and level of contribution, I believe that your manuscript may be better received at a more specialized journal that focuses on scale measurement.  I realize that the current decision is not what you desired. However, I hope that the relatively quick turnaround will help you to make more timely progress compared with waiting for a full set of reviews and that the feedback will prove helpful in preparing a manuscript that can be published at some point. I wish you success in finding an appropriate outlet for your work.   Best wishes, Dr. Maria-Paola Paladino Associate Editor Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin |
