maybe add this quote:

“In any case, considerable empirical work will be required to investigate this area fully and to assess the reliability and validity of the IRAP as a measure of implicit beliefs and attitudes.” (McKenna et al., 2007, p. 267)

“research on the IRAP as an implicit measure is still quite limited, and thus further empirical inquiry is needed before its reliability and validity may be determined.” (Barnes-Holmes et al., 2009, p. 391)
